# Prose

`<Prose />` should wrap any piece of continous text comprised of multiple consecutive elements/line breaks. The component takes care of the spacing between consecutive elements by adding a top-margin to adjacent components.

The amount of spacing is controlled by setting the `--prose-top-spacing` custom property on the individual child elements.
